Project Description:

My project is an updated insult library(Bitter). The app will give you insults to save and use whenever you need. You can add your own special insults and even delete insults you dont think are good.

Issues and Resolutions
Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.


raise ImproperlyConfigured(
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Cannot import 'authentication'. Check that 'apps.authentication.apps.AuthenticationConfig.name' is
correct.

This was an error I kept getting and my issues was that I tried to speed run through making the 
whole authentication the Suresh way and I couldn't even figure out where the issue was even with 
everyone in my group helping me. Anyway the resolution was starting over so it's 9/15/2020 right now 
and I just copied Alex's authentication and refactored that and my server can run right now.
